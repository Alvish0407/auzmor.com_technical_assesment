A mobile app to check for Trainings offered.

Your challenge is to implement a mobile app using Flutter (Dart), let’s call it My Trainings App.
This will be used by the Users to discover trainings that they are interested in.

Your code will be judged primarily on:
1. Performance: Ability for the user to perform operations intuitively and the speed in which the
screen transitions/actions happen

2. Coding style: Code design and structure. Abstraction and componentization. And in general,
cleanliness of code.

3. Correctness (goes without saying!)
   
You need to implement the following:

Two general notes:
1. Your code MUST be in working condition
2. You will need to provide running instructions
